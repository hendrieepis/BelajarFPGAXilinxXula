Checking timing specifications ...
WARNING:XdmHelpers:662 - Period specification "TS_clk" references the TNM group
   "clk", which contains both pads and synchronous elements. The timing analyzer
   will ignore the pads for this specification. You might want to use a
   qualifier (e.g. "FFS") on the TNM property to remove the pads from this
   group.
