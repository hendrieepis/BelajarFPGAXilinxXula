The following files were generated for 'ScreenRam' in directory 
C:\xesscorp\PRODUCTS\BITSTREAMS\XSA\3S1000\vga_bram\ipcore_dir\

ScreenRam.asy:
   Graphical symbol information file. Used by the ISE tools and some
   third party tools to create a symbol representing the core.

ScreenRam.gise:
   ISE Project Navigator support file. This is a generated file and should
   not be edited directly.

ScreenRam.ise:
   ISE Project Navigator support file. This is a generated file and should
   not be edited directly.

ScreenRam.ngc:
   Binary Xilinx implementation netlist file containing the information
   required to implement the module in a Xilinx (R) FPGA.

ScreenRam.sym:
   Please see the core data sheet.

ScreenRam.v:
   Verilog wrapper file provided to support functional simulation.
   This file contains simulation model customization data that is
   passed to a parameterized simulation model for the core.

ScreenRam.veo:
   VEO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a Verilog design.

ScreenRam.vhd:
   VHDL wrapper file provided to support functional simulation. This
   file contains simulation model customization data that is passed to
   a parameterized simulation model for the core.

ScreenRam.vho:
   VHO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.

ScreenRam.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.

ScreenRam.xise:
   ISE Project Navigator support file. This is a generated file and should
   not be edited directly.

ScreenRam_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

ScreenRam_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

ScreenRam_xmdf.tcl:
   ISE Project Navigator interface file. ISE uses this file to determine
   how the files output by CORE Generator for the core can be integrated
   into your ISE project.

blk_mem_gen_ds512.pdf:
   Please see the core data sheet.


Please see the Xilinx CORE Generator online help for further details on
generated files and how to use them.
