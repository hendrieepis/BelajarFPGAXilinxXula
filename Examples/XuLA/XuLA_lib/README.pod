=head1 XuLA Library Files

These HDL files describe modules that are useful in a variety of larger designs.

=over 4

=item * ClkGen.vhd

A clock generator module that uses a DCM to multiply or divide an input clock to create an
output clock with a higher or lower frequency.

=item * Common.vhd

Contains useful constants and functions.

=item * FlashCntl.vhd

A module that provides read/write access to the serial flash device on the XuLA board.

=item * HostIo.vhd

A set of modules that let a host PC pass data back-and-forth with
a user design running in the FPGA.

=item * MemTest.vhd

A module that writes a random stream of values to memory.

=item * RandGen.vhd

An LFSR-based module for generating random values.

=item * SdramCntl.vhd

An interface module that makes an SDRAM appear as a simple SRAM-like memory to
a user design in the FPGA.

=item * SyncToClk.vhd

Modules that sync one or more signals crossing from one clock domain to another.

=item * TestBoardCore.vhd

A module that tests the functioning of a XuLA board by writing a random stream of values into SDRAM
and then reading it back and comparing it to the original.

=item * UserInstrJtag.vhd

A module that accepts commands and data via the FPGA JTAG port and sends them to modules in the
FPGA. (Deprecated - superseded by the HostIo modules.)

=item * Vga.vhd

Modules for generating bitmapped and character mapped displays on VGA monitors.
